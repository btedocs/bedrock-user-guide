## Introduction

Before starting, it is imperative that you are on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/3mrQBYd) server. If you haven't joined yet, please do so before reading the rest of this document.

At BTE, we also support the Bedrock edition of Minecraft, which will allow you to not only contribute to building the whole world with your mobile device, console or other device, but also have fun building yourself or play together with your friends the same way you would on the Java edition of Minecraft.

We hope all the information in this document will have proven itself useful to you, and if not, you’re free to contact us either via opening a ticket using the @BTE Support bot or asking us in the \#bedrock-support channel.

## 1. Singleplayer

CAUTION: Building in singleplayer requires a computer to run the local server, but does not need to have Minecraft on it.

### 1.1. Requesting a region

If you would like to play on your own, DM the `BTE Support` bot, which you can find in the member list on the right. Send the following information to the bot:

Region number\(s\): `(-)#####.(-)#####`

The region number is not the same as coordinates of the plot! It can be found by clicking on a region \(blue square\) on the [Interactive Map](https://buildtheearth.net/map). A Bedrock team member will then DM you via the support bot with everything necessary to contribute by setting up your local server, including your custom world and instructions. Please be patient for them, as sometimes it can take a while!

### 1.2. Getting support

If, for some reason, you're experiencing issues with your region, the local server or something else, you can contact the Bedrock support team either via the \#bedrock-support channel on our Discord server or using the same BTE Support bot from earlier.

If the discussion you had with our staff has not proven useful, you can always try again at a different time or open another ticket, we promise we'll try our hardest to give each and every one of you the best help and support we can offer.

## 2. Multiplayer

Before we start, we would like to point out that we highly prefer you, the builder, to opt for the multiplayer option when building rather than singleplayer, as it's far more beneficial to the project and not only does it enable you to build together with your friends, but it also makes new friendships possible.

### 2.1. Joining a Build Team

To join a Build Team, look in the "Join a Build Team" category in our Discord server as shown in the following image:

![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/731573774507442211/777828070055739472/btpic.PNG)

There, you'll find channels for specific continents, so for example, if you wanted to join the UK Build Team, you would go to the \#europe channel. To join your Build Team of choice, simply join said Build Team's Discord server.

Most teams have their own Minecraft server which you can join, play on and build on. The IP for such servers can usually be found in one of the information channels on said Build Team’s Discord server.

CAUTION: Not all teams’ servers have Bedrock support, so to make sure they have, it’s best to contact a staff member from that server. If they don’t support Bedrock, you may politely ask them to add the support.

### 2.2. Joining a server on Windows 10 or Mobile

WBefore we start, we would also like to point out that the Windows 10 edition and Mobile editions of Bedrock are nearly identical and don't have the same issues when connecting to external servers as consoles do.

To connect to an external server, follow these instructions:

1. Open Minecraft on your phone or Windows 10 computer
2. Click the `Play` button
3. Go to the `Servers` tab in the top right corner of the screen
4. Scroll down the server list until you see an "Additional Servers" category
5. On the bottom of that category should be an `Add Server` button, press it
6. In the `Server Name` field, you're free to input whatever you like
7. In the `Server Address` field, input the IP address of the server you would like to join
8. Finally, in the `Port` field, you want to make sure it's the number `19132`, as that's the Bedrock server port number
9. Then simply click the `Play` button and hopefully you'll soon be on the server

### 2.3. Joining a server on Console

Joining and adding online external servers can not be done by default for consoles. Therefore, the default settings must be edited. Below is a guide for doing exactly that.

We've included images here so as to make the setup process as easy as possible. If any of the images are unclear, please contact the Bedrock Support team.

Depending on your console, the setup process will be different, so use this jumplist to get to the instructions for your console:

* Xbox
* PlayStation 4
* Switch

#### 2.3.1. Xbox

1. Open the Settings app on your Xbox and go to `Network settings`

1. In the next menu, it will ask you to set your Primary and Secondary DNS. In the Primary DNS field enter `104.238.130.180` and in the Secondary DNS field enter `001.001.001.001`
2. Click the `Save` button to save the changes
3. After you've done that and confirmed all the changes, read the instructions in 2.2. Joining a server on Windows 10 or Mobile as the steps from now on are identical to those

### 2.4. Setting up your own server

If you would like to set up your own server with Bedrock support or you're starting a Build Team and you want to have a server of your own, you can read the [Bedrock Server Setup Guide](https://bteguides.gitbook.io/bedrock-server-setup-guide/).

## 3. Troubleshooting

In this section, we'll outline most of the problems that may arrise when using the Bedrock edition of Minecraft.

### 3.1. Singleplayer

Most of the singleplayer issues will be due to a bad configuration, so please double check everything you did up until this point. This means that it would be wise to go back to section 2. Multiplayer and make sure you've done the setup process correctly for your platform.

#### 3.1.1. Can't connect to server

This is likely due to your Internet connection, so make sure you're connected to the Internet and the connection is stable before trying anything else.

If that hasn't worked, please contact the support team. Information on how to do that is listed at the bottom of Introduction.

#### 3.1.2. Running both client and server on Windows 10

If you're running both the server and the client on Windows 10, make sure the IP field says either `127.0.0.1` or `localhost` and that the port is `19132`.

If that didn't work, open a PowerShell window and execute the following command: `CheckNetIsolation LoopbackExempt -a -n="Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe"` \(you may need to restart the server and client after running this\)

#### 3.1.3. Making sure the server is running correctly

When running the server on your computer, make sure it outputs a `Done!` message when it finishes starting.

If this is not the case or you get a lot of errors, please contact our support team. Information on how to do that is listed at the bottom of Introduction.

#### 3.1.4. None of this has solved my problem

If none of the above fixes solved your problem, there is a chance you will need to port forward. [This guide](https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/general-port-forwarding-guide/) explains the process well.

In case the port forward didn't work either, please contact our support team. Information on how to do that is listed at the bottom of Introduction.

### 3.2. Multiplayer

Any multiplayer issues should be addressed directly with the staff/support team of the Build Team whose server you've played on.
